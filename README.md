Please add other assets to `/public/**`.

`/public/assets/images/foo/bar.png`

// for fonts
`/public/assets/images/foo.ttf`

If you want to get bundle files, There is `yarn run dev-build` or `yarn run build` commands.

The following is way of loading assets. You have to load bundle file in HTML like this.
```

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/stylesheets/bundle.css">
<script src="/assets/javascripts/bundle.js"></script>
```
